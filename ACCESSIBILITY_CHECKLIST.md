## Lighthouse Accessibility Audit

Date: June 27, 2026

Lighthouse was run as an automated accessibility check only against the local site at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/
```

Lighthouse does not establish full ADA or WCAG compliance. Scores below reflect only the automated Lighthouse accessibility category for the tested pages.

### Pages Audited

Initial audited pages:

- `/`
- `/pages/accessibility.html`
- `/pages/financial-forecast.html`
- `/pages/fund-financial-schedules.html`
- `/pages/departments.html`

Initial scores and issues:

| Page | Initial Score | Lighthouse Issues |
| --- | ---: | --- |

- Bumped `walton-budget-nav.js` and `walton-budget-search.js` cache keys to `20260627-lighthouse-a11y`.

Hidden/admin-only dark mode was not changed.

### Final Lighthouse Results

After the targeted fixes, Lighthouse accessibility was rerun on the same pages.

| Page | Final Score | Remaining Lighthouse Accessibility Issues |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `/` | 100 | None reported. |
| `/pages/accessibility.html` | 100 | None reported. |

- A complete manual screen reader pass has not been run.
- A complete page-by-page keyboard audit across every public page has not been run.

## View Prior Years Toggle Keyboard Fix

Date: June 27, 2026

### Issue Found

Manual keyboard testing found that the "View Prior Years" control was visually clickable, but did not behave reliably as a keyboard-operated disclosure control.

### User Impact

Keyboard-only users needed to be able to Tab to the control and toggle prior-year columns with Enter or Space, with a clear visible focus state and a meaningful accessible name.

### Files Changed

- `assets/budget-data.js`
- `assets/walton-budget-nav.js`
- `assets/style.css`
- Static HTML cache keys for `style.css`, `budget-data.js`, and `walton-budget-nav.js`

### Fix Made

- Replaced the rendered shared "View Prior Years" control with a real `<button type="button">`.
- Added `aria-expanded="false"` / `aria-expanded="true"` state updates.
- Updated the accessible name between "View prior years" and "Hide prior years".
- Updated the visible label between "View Prior Years" and "Hide Prior Years".
- Added a visible `:focus-visible` focus ring.
- Preserved the old checkbox handler as a compatibility fallback for any legacy-rendered toggles.
- Reset cloned button bindings inside budget-detail modal content before rebinding toggle behavior.
- Updated the older shared-nav injected table toggle to use the same button behavior.
- Bumped cache keys to `20260627-prior-years-a11y`.

No financial logic, Supabase logic, transaction filters, forecast assumptions, FY2027 revenue dedupe logic, raw data exposure, or hidden/admin-only dark mode behavior was changed.

### Browser / Keyboard Verification Result

Tested with Playwright against:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8766/pages/fund-financial-schedules.html
```

Results:

- The "View Prior Years" control was reached by Tab as a `button`.
- The focused control had a visible focus ring: `3px` solid outline plus focus shadow.
- Initial state exposed `aria-expanded="false"` and accessible name `View prior years`.
- Enter toggled prior-year content on and changed `aria-expanded` to `true`.
- Space toggled prior-year content back off and changed `aria-expanded` to `false`.
- Mouse click toggled prior-year content on.
- No browser console errors or page errors were recorded during the test.

### Remaining Issues

- This was a focused verification of the "View Prior Years" toggle, not a full ADA or WCAG compliance audit.

## Axe-Core Accessibility Audit

Date: June 27, 2026

axe-core was run through Playwright as an automated accessibility check only against:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/
```

axe-core does not establish full ADA or WCAG compliance. Results below reflect only automated axe checks for the tested pages.

### Pages Tested

- `/`
- `/pages/accessibility.html`
- `/pages/financial-forecast.html`
- `/pages/fund-financial-schedules.html`
- `/pages/departments.html`

### Initial Axe Violations Found

All five tested pages reported one `serious` violation:

- `avoid-inline-spacing`: inline text spacing must be adjustable with custom stylesheets.
- Affected node: `.wc-split-brand-bottom`.
- Cause: the split-logo equalization script wrote inline `letter-spacing` with `!important`.

The home page also had one axe `incomplete` ARIA item:

- `aria-prohibited-attr`: `.wc-split-brand` was a plain `div` with `aria-label`.

axe also listed `color-contrast` as `incomplete` on the tested pages. These were not reported as violations by axe and still require manual review where relevant.

### Axe Fixes Made

- Removed `!important` from the split-logo dynamic inline `letter-spacing` in `assets/walton-split-logo.js`.
- Removed unsupported `aria-label` from the plain `.wc-split-brand` `div` in `assets/walton-split-logo.js`.
- Removed the same unsupported `aria-label` from the fallback `.wc-split-brand` `div` in `assets/walton-budget-nav.js`.
- Bumped the split-logo cache key to `20260627-axe-a11y`.

No financial logic, Supabase logic, transaction filters, forecast assumptions, raw data exposure, or hidden/admin-only dark mode styles were changed.

### Final Axe Results

After the targeted fixes, axe-core was rerun on the same five pages.

| Page | Axe Violations | Remaining Axe Incomplete Items |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `/` | 0 | `color-contrast`, 13 nodes marked incomplete |
| `/pages/accessibility.html` | 0 | `color-contrast`, 8 nodes marked incomplete |
| `/pages/financial-forecast.html` | 0 | `color-contrast`, 102 nodes marked incomplete |
| `/pages/fund-financial-schedules.html` | 0 | `color-contrast`, 136 nodes marked incomplete |
| `/pages/departments.html` | 0 | `color-contrast`, 37 nodes marked incomplete |

### Remaining Issues / Manual Review

- axe reported no violations on the tested pages after fixes.
- axe `color-contrast` results remained incomplete and should be reviewed manually where relevant.
- Full ADA compliance is not claimed.
- Full WCAG compliance is not claimed.
- A complete manual screen reader pass has not been run.

## Accessibility Page Contact Information Update

Date: June 27, 2026

`/pages/accessibility.html` was rewritten to replace placeholder contact text (`[Insert department/contact email]`, `[Insert phone number]`, `[Insert mailing address if desired]`, `[Insert date]`) with the County's actual accessibility/nondiscrimination contact, and to add the page sections requested: Website Accessibility, Accessibility and Nondiscrimination Assistance, Accessibility Design Guidelines, Browser Accessibility Information, Documents and Alternate Formats, Supported Assistive Technology, and Ongoing Accessibility Work.

No financial logic, Supabase logic, transaction filters, forecast assumptions, FY2027 revenue dedupe logic, or hidden/admin-only dark mode styles were touched.

### Contact Information Now Shown

- Jonathon Cornman
- Walton County Title VI/Nondiscrimination Coordinator
- 45 N. 6th Street
- DeFuniak Springs, FL 32433
- Phone: `(850) 892-8586` (linked as `tel:8508928586`)
- Email: `corjonathon@co.walton.fl.us` (linked as `mailto:corjonathon@co.walton.fl.us`)

The previous placeholder address (`176 Montgomery Cir., DeFuniak Springs, FL 32435`) and phone number (`(850) 892-8470`) were not present in the prior page content and required no removal beyond replacing the bracketed placeholders.

### Compliance Language Check

- Page does not state or imply "fully ADA compliant," "fully WCAG compliant," "guaranteed accessible," or "complies with all accessibility laws."
- Page uses "designed to support accessibility," "consistent with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA," and "Accessibility is an ongoing effort."

### Verification Result

Verified in a headless browser against the local static site:

- Exactly one `<h1>` on the page (`Accessibility Statement`).
- Contact block renders all six required contact lines (name, title, street, city/state/zip, phone, email).
- No old/placeholder address, phone number, or bracketed placeholder text remains.
- `mailto:corjonathon@co.walton.fl.us` and `tel:8508928586` links are both present.
- Footer `Accessibility` link still resolves to `accessibility.html` and renders once.
- Skip link still works: Tab focuses "Skip to main content," Enter moves the URL hash to `#main-content` and focus to the injected `#main-content` target.
- No browser console errors or page errors were recorded.
- A complete page-by-page keyboard audit across every public page has not been run.
